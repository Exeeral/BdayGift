<h1>ooooooo the futureeeee</h1>

<p>
    The future is such an elusive weird thing. If we could  see the future,
    it'd be boring. We would know what is going to happe, we would not ever be
    surprised and life would be grey and uninspiring. But I digress.
    Even as an alter ego I still talk a lot. Sorry.
