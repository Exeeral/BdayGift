<h1>WOOO THE FUTUREEEE</h1>

<p class="lightShadowed">
    The future is such an elusive weird thing. If we could see the future,
    it'd be boring. We would know what is going to happen, we would not ever be
    surprised and life would be grey and uninspiring. Ah, but I digress.
    Even as an alter ego I still talk a lot. Sorry.<br><br>

        Let me butt in a little bit and 
        You both will achieve a success in your lives. Being a famous
        artist getting tons of tasks, with the world-wide recognition,
        you will be short on time. You will be great at your job, but
        overworking always takes its toll. Be sure to catch some breath.<br><br>

        What about your friends? Being such a public figure could lead you
        to other places in the world. That I can't foresee. It's up to you to decide
        where your dreams will take you. Will the whims of fate guide you to an
        ultimate happy ending or will you be miserable after choosing the wrong
        path? Will you remember the people of the past or will you live
        in the future's present? Will you be pursuing your career greatness or
        balance it well with pleasures? Find answers to these questions.
        They seem to be important. No matter the choice, you are smart and talented,
        so don't fret. You will always find a way out. And there is one person who is always
        happy to lend you a hand whenever you need it...<br><br>
