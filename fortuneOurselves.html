<h1>WOOO THE FUTUREEEE</h1>

<p>
    The future is such an elusive weird thing. If we could see the future,
    it'd be boring. We would know what is going to happen, we would not ever be
    surprised and life would be grey and uninspiring. But I digress.
    Even as an alter ego I still talk a lot. Sorry.<br><br>

    Scroll doooown for my fortune telling!

        You both will achieve a success in your lives. Being a famous
        artist getting tons of tasks, with the world-wide recognition,
        you will be short on time. You will be great at your job, but
        overworking always takes its toll. Be sure to catch some breath.<br><br>

        What about your friends? Being such a public figure could lead you
        to other places in the world. That I can't foresee. It's up to you to decide
        where your dreams will take you. Will the whims of fate guide you to an
        ultimate happy ending or will you be miserable after choosing the wrong
        path? Will you remember the people of the past or will you live
        in the future's present? Will you be pursuing your career greatness or
        balance it well with pleasures? Find an answer to these questions.
        They seem to be important. No matter the choice, you are smart and talented,
        so don't fret. You will always find a way out. And there is one person who is always
        happy to lend you a hand whenever required...<br><br>

        ...I'm talking Exeeral! Now this guy is a beast! He is hot and smart and
        funny and he has it all! He swears a lot but even such a sweet ass
        has some cons. Not a lof of them. His future revolves around working,
        mostly. He is an insecure little bitch that he questions the bonds he made with
        people, making his actions unpredictable. Nobody knows what's in his dumb tiny head,
        not even himself. I won't be reading his fortune, but by reading yours, I got some
        hints about him. Like the fact that in the distant future, he is never going to leave you behind.
        I have no idea which of his flaws you know about, but one thing is for sure: he will be trying
        his best to be a good person to you. Hopefully just "trying" will be good enough.<br><br>

        I don't know you and I don't know him. I am an alter ego in another body after all. But
        you two seem to be getting along, so let's fortune-tell your friendship's future, huh?
        I mean, unless we did already. Which fortune telling did you click first? Doesn't matter.
        Sounds good? ⭐✨⭐✨⭐ Leeeeessss gooooooooooooo!!! ⭐✨⭐✨⭐
