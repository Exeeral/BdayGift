        Eastery Egg 2 Found!<br><br>

        This easter egg was hidden under the first letter of your name,
        so it'll be about you. Now I can't write any facts about you,
        so I can write fun facts about the way I see you.<br><br>

        You seem to be someone who is living their best life.
        I think you are a chill person, you don't get bored of people
        but you do get bored of being idle real quick. Like an ADHD.
        You also seem to be a very academic type of girl. Learning,
        caring about grades a lot, getting very good grades and being a good student.
        But then you become a different person when you go to parties or when you are out with
        friends. Not that I have ever experienced it, you just seem that way.<br><br>

        And you seem to be a girl who is awful and unbearable when drunk. Too much all over the place,
        affectionate little bitch, flirty type, who can barely stand still on her legs. You seem
        like that one girl who wakes up in the bathtub hugging other guy after a party night,
        not remembering anything.
        Hopefully you're not like this. <br><br>
        
        You also seem like a person who hates being silent around
        people. Like when out with someone, or spending time with someone. It seems like
        you're not having fun when you both get quiet. Maybe you're even getting bored in such situations?
        You also seem to be a popular type of person. Tons of friends, always busy with answering
        calls and messages, under the fire, rejecting tons of guys and their feelings.
        It feels cringe saying it but that's how you seem to be.
        I wonder if you have any internal struggles.
