        Easter Egg 4: "Sing a Thing" card<br><br>

        God I hoped you'd not find this one. That's why it was so well-hidden. It's already embarrassing.<br><br>

        This card gives you a pass to ask me to sing any song for you.
        So uh.....................<br><br>

        The reason I added this easter egg was to make things more interesting,
        and losing something important always makes things interesting.
        And I will be losing my dignity. For the love of God, don't fucking
        pick anything awful. <br><br>

        Screenshot gives you a pass. Hopefully I won't see this page as
        a screenshot on Discord. I hope. I pray.
