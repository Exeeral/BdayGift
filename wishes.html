        <h1>Happy Birthday To You!</h1>

        <p>
            <span class="bigLetter">H</span>ey, <a href="easteregg2.html">M</a>onnie. I could be wishing you to be healthy, happy, to get tons of gifts,
            and all that, you know the drill. Instead, I'd rather say something from
            the bottom of my heart and not repeat the same thing you hear each year from
            everyone.<br><br>

            <span class="bigLetter">F</span>irst off, I hope you'll be having a great day today and an ass-clappin' birthday party.
            Don't drink too much, don't overdose on ketamine and come back to me alive, we still have
            so many things to do. For your birthday, I was considering many gifts. A drawing, just like
            you gave me one (still can't quite believe it, thank you so much ;0). But I suck at drawing.
            A 3D render of some sorts, with the wishes under it on Discord. But that'd suck. So I came to the
            conclusion that I fucking suck at everything and I had no idea what to give you, and so I decided to go with
            whatever I can do and here we are. Not the best gift, I know, but I had no idea what else I could do.
            All the renders, images and code I did myself, I hope you like it.<br><br>

            <span class="bigLetter">I</span> want to thank you for almost a year of solid friendship. It was a year of talking almost every day, which
            is insane. We went though deep topics, laughed at some dumb shit, played games, watched movies,
            and so many things, with more stuff yet to come. For a pair of strangers who don't know each other,
            it really is a sophisticated relationship. I will be a bit corny here since it's your birthday 
            (don't get used to it) and I'll say that you really caught me off guard so many times, mostly
            by behaving like a true friend I never had. You make me smile up when you behave like a bitch
            and then you make things more wholesome when you're nice. Many times I thought that it might be
            some play or that you're not even the person you claim to be, thinking of abandoning you.
            It's kinda because I thought our friendship is too good to be true. Your interest in whatever I say
            to be forced. Your personality to be a mask. That you're putting me on a safe distance. Foolish me.
            I thought that if all of it is real and not some catfishing or a lie, then I really don't deserve such
            a friend. And so far, I stand by the thought that you're great and I hope you never change.
            To be fair, you have no idea how many times you've lightened my mood and made my day good when I
            felt awful. Such a shining beacon you were, like no one ever before, and I've never even met you.
            I know that many times I'm rough around the edges, not enough and perhaps seeming negative
            towards you, but in all fairness, I enjoy every single second I spend with you. Even
            when we get sucked into some small talk, even during our worst days, it always is a blast.<br><br>

            <span class="bigLetter">A</span>lthough I tried to make it more brief, trying to find the right words, 
            fitting the way I think of you and how honored I am to call myself your friend, I found it too difficult.
            We disliked each other back in time, but full glad I am that it ended this way and now I know that I missed out on 
            you for many years. I've never said it before, but you really are amazing. Thank you for being 
            my friend. Sorry if I've ever done anything wrong. I always screw some things up when I care, and I think 
            I care too much. Can't get enough of you and I hope that one day we will become the best friends.
            Let us better our friendship, as I will be here for you forever.<br><br>

            (Damn it got real long real fast. But there are not many occassions to wish you wishes and
            tell you thingy things.)
