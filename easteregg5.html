        Easter Egg 5: The drawing<br><br>

        Sooo I gave this drawing a second attempt. I am really trying
        my best here :( I was trying to base you off of the information
        available to me (only your facebook profile pic).
        These are probably my first drawings since kindergarten.
        Please forgive me. I just wanted to give you something nice
        like you did for my birthday :( I watched 2 different tutorials
        but I guess no talent means no results.
