<h1 class="looneyTunesFont">That's All Folks!</h1>

<p>
    That's where we end our journey. As you might recognize,
    it's me again, Exeeral. With this gift, I didn't want to
    just wish you wishes, but also tell you that
    you are the best. I hope you liked what I made,
    it's not the best gift you received, but I wanted to give you
    something made by me, just like you did May 8th. I know these
    were not the best wishes and I probably said things that
    were not describing our friendship well, but you know
    how clumsy I am with my words. It's a bit corny and cringy
    but it was supposed to be this way. I can explain more
    the next time we talk.<br><br>

    Monnie, thank you for sticking around with me for that long.
    You mean a lot, truly.<br><br>
    So, what will we be doing tomorrow?
