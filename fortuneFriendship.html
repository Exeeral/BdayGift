<h1>WOOO THE FUTUREEEE</h1>

<p>
    The future is such an elusive weird thing. If we could see the future,
    it'd be boring. We would know what is going to happen, we would not ever be
    surprised and life would be grey and uninspiring. Ah, but I digress.
    Even as an alter ego I still talk a lot. Sorry.<br><br>

    Scroll doooown for my fortune telling!

<div class="fortuneContent">
    <div class="center description">
        In the previous fortune telling (Yourselves), I told you that there is
        a person who will always be happy to help you no matter what yadda yadda.
        I mean, unless you are fortune-telling in the wrong order, hopefully
        you're not that dumb.
        Alright, This is an interesting individual I briefly mentioned is - and you won't expect that...
        <br><br><br><br>

        ...I'm talking Exeeral! Now this guy is a beast! Not only hot but also smart and
        funny and he has it all! He swears a lot but even such a sweet ass
        has some cons. Not a lof of them, though. His future revolves around working,
        mostly. He is an insecure little bitch that questions the bonds he made with
        people, making his actions unpredictable. Nobody knows what's in his dumb tiny head,
        not even himself. I won't be reading his fortune, but by reading yours, I got some
        hints about him. Like the fact that in the distant future, he is never going to leave you behind.
        I have no idea which of his flaws you know about, but one thing is for sure: he will be trying
        his best to be a good person to you. Hopefully just "trying" will be good enough.<br><br>

        Here my fortune telling goes a libble bit awry. As far as I can predict people's
        futures, I can't foresee their emotions which lead to statuses, like a friendship.
        I know that Exeeral will be trying to be your good friend in the future, but
        does this mean you will still be friends, best friends, just acquaintences
        or business partners? Only you will know when the time comes. The only
        fortune telling I can offer is with what I see currently. <br><br>

        So, what do I see currently, you might ask. I see that you both seem to be caring,
        you both seem to be having fun, and you both seem to be making each other happy.
        I'm more of a specialist when it comes to human emotions compared to this dull
        Exeeral motherfucker who can't tell the cry of joy from the cry of sadness, and so
        I see a true beauty in what you two are creating. Don't fuck this up or I'll fuck you up.
        Yours is the wisdom to weave the fabric of reality. Yours is the power to create!<br><br>

        As Exeeral's Alter Ego, I'm a little bit like him, you know. I am condensed "insides" of his psyche,
        the hidden personality. The one he doesn't want to show. Imagine a little, joyful, energetic boy
        smiling up, laughing at everything. The one with hidden values, ideas. Acting in the shadows
        of his "true" self. But which self is the "true" one? Sometimes he manifests his alter ego
        through his actions, but rarely. When he does, he might seem like he is a different person.
        Sometimes he shows his second personality to you, as living just one is not like him. Or maybe having
        multiple personalities creates the one true identity - yourself? That's who he is, and that's
        why I'm telling you all this -- will you be able to accept his other selves? Will you accept
        his worsts, while also enjoying his bests? Do you despise him at times just to be happy with him
        the other times? If you are able to answer these questions positively, you are in for a long journey.
        Since myself and him have one thing in common. If we feel useless, not liked or like we
        are in the wrong place in the wrong time, we run away. We can't accept being less than ideal.
        So if you ever see him running away, it's not because he hates you. He just doesn't want
        to feel like he is annoying, upsetting or confusing you. He hates letting you down, and I guess
        sometimes he does. What is your answer?<br><br>

        What I just said is pretty obvious. Everyone has their different "selves", but
        not everyone accepts all of them. And through not only yours but also his acceptance,
        you are able to build the most healthy of relationships ever created. It will last
        as long as you are able to accept yourselves. That is your fortune.<br><br>
