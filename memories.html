                    and not wanting to befriend me again or check on me but being a self-indulging,
                    egoistic, weird and all the other bad words, but wanting only to clear your name
                    (you never did tho). Disgusting. But I'm still glad it happened.

                    Now, of course we both lied. You didn't think I was amazing, and
                    I didn't really think that "It's good between us" and didn't really care,
                    thinking you'd let go after this conversation and never talk to me again.
                    But for some mysterious reason, you started writing to me very often.
                    It seemed weird, but after a while I thought to myself "She seems
                    to be kinda nice. Can't be ;0". And so, with the time being our ally,
                    we somehow began our friendship.

                    As the time went by, I started liking you a lot and caring,
                    still thinking that you might be jesting. I felt kind of like
                    a loser who is not sure if he can trust you and is not being
                    played. With some of your reassuring I started to believe that
                    we really are friends.
                    But before that happened, you were asking questions. Tons of questions.

                    Mine is also black :]<br>
                    But that is unfortunately not a color<br>

                    Do you still refuse to download TikTok<br><br>

                    Exeeral [1]<br>
                    Black is a color, I'd even say that it can't be a shade because it's composed of no color at all<br><br>

                    Monnie<br>

                    I would ask you to refrain from interrupting me again<br>

                So basically if you get touched<br>
                by someone you're into<br>
                You get fucking erection<br>
                Your clit fucking cracks and produces water<br>
                like a rock<br><br>

                Then, one day, a Minecraft Accident happened.<br><br>

                Minecraft Accident, Secret Acts:<br>
                The culprits were
                always talking a lot when playing Minecraft together. But that day, 
                one of them, Exeeral, was enjoying himself building a dungeon basement for their little house. 
                In complete silence. The second culprit seemed to be upset,
                so Exeeral started asking questions, but she was ditching them. Later on
                Monnie D. revealed on Discord that she felt like her Minecraft partner
                wasn't having fun and that made her feel sad and insecure.

                thank you really<br>
                i was only worried that you would be disappointed<br><br>

                Exeeral<br>
                You might just be the best person I know online so far and it's only a shame I can't know you personally<br>
                Don't think of me not having fun with you because<br>
                At this point, you could have gone completely silent and not talk to me at all<br>
                Just nod back<br>
                and I'd still have fun<br>
                I mean, i'd be concerned about the fact that you might be not having fun, but other than that personally<br>
                I'm sold<br><br>

                First month, all the topics in the world discussed ;0<br>
                Later on it was just situational<br>
                If something happened, we'd talk about it<br>
                How long are we talking now? 4 months?<br>
                And these convos are still fucking deep and interesting and funny as well<br><br>

                Being absolutely honest with you, that day you made me go
                "Awwwww" for the first time. It was really nice, you were worried that I didn't have fun.
                It was the first time when I thought that I'm not just a random nobody for you,
                but someone you, maybe, hopefully, care about, even if I was a stranger. It might be
                a little bit selfish, but the way you were concerned about me made me kinda... Happy?
                It's a bit cheesy, but the truth is the truth. And when you read the quote on the
                right side, you probably cringed, you always do that in such moments, but to be fair,
                you were really, as you call it, "precious" back then, reassuring. Unless it wasn't about that? 
                It seemed to be that way.<br><br>

                This conversation was a bit lengthy, so I didn't paste a lot of it. If you're interested:
                Discord timestamp 04.02.2022, 01:44 your local time and 05.02.2022.

                Okay, the previous memory was a bit wholesome, but of course it couldn't
                be like this forever. And so, something horryfing happened. Something 
                unexpected. Awful. I feel dread everytime I think of it. A new era began...

                The movies we watched! We started with The Silent Voice, and then went with
                Your Name. Both movies were great, but Your Name was magical. Watching
                it with you made it even better. I wanted to pause
                so many times just to admire the visuals. One of the most memorable

                We're now at the very bottom. We went from the furthest
                to the newest events and all of it was fun time.
                Lots of things changed, as you can see.
                Makes me wonder - do you prefer the way we were in these 
                memories, or are we better now? Do you like the way I was before
                or the way I am now? I certainly know that I enjoy you the way you are.
                You said many times that when talking to me, you're yourself and you're not
                pretending to be someone else, and if that is the real you, I'm really glad
                you are this way.<br><br>

                We are in the present now. So what are we doing? You're on a vacation
                as of the time of me writing this (19.05.2022). You're still learning Art on your own,
                celebrating tons of birthdays, meeting your friends constantly
                and who knows what else. I barely know a thing about you. You also
                danced with your friend and hit some old guy's chair with your head.
                And what am I doing? I'm writing this text and preparing to go to bed.
                I'm learning programming and hoping to land a job in Gamedev.
                And we both are doing one thing - still being good friends.
                Maybe one day we will look at this site thinking "Damn, we didn't
                know so many things which we know now", laughing and you'd probably
                say something like "Look, you were so stupid back then! Not that
                anything has changed." You're too predictable. As you can see, I've
                instantly jumped into the future. So let's see where our futures could take us - 
                our last stop on this site.
