        Easter Egg 1: Fun fact about me.<br><br>

        I used to be an edgy silent boy for 2 years when I was like 14 or 15.
        I stopped talking to people, trying to be a protagonist kind of dumbass.
        I was ignoring everyone, trying to spend my time all alone, thinking of my
        future and not caring at all, walking in awful clothes. Before that,
        I was the most energetic guy, with tons of friends, always saying stuff
        that'd make people laugh. I think it was this way? But I didn't like myself,
        that's why I changed to that silent guy. Regretted it later on. Bad old times.<br><br>

        Then I went to the middle school (we have something like that in Poland), which
        was my school up to this year. I was the energetic "funny" guy once more. And it hadn't
        changed, except that I'm a bit calmer than 3 years ago. And less cringe I think.<br><br>
